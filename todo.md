Map-Based Visualization:
Use latitude and longitude data to create an interactive map of the United States. Each reported sighting will be represented as a point on the map.

Statistical Analysis:
Provide summary statistics like the total number of reports, average distance from populated areas, or average classification. These statistics can be displayed alongside the map.

Filtering by Classification:
Allow users to filter the data by classification (Class A, B, C) using interactive buttons or dropdown menus. This will enable users to focus on specific types of sightings.

User Interaction:
Implement features like zooming, panning, and the ability to click on data points for more detailed information. Users should be able to explore the map and interact with the data.
